Only a part of this input, however, is responsible for the failure. Reducing the input to a failure-inducing minimum not only eases debugging – it also helps in understanding why and when the program fails. In this chapter, we present techniques that automatically reduce and simplify failure-inducing inputs to a minimum, notably the popular Delta Debugging technique.\">Reducing Failure-Inducing Inputs</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"ChangeDebugger.ipynb\" title=\"Isolating Failure-Inducing Changes (ChangeDebugger)&#10;&#10;&quot;Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why?&quot; In debugging, as elsewhere in software development, code keeps on changing. Thus, it can happen that a piece of code that yesterday was working perfectly, today no longer runs – because we (or others) have made some changes to it that cause it to fail. The good news is that for debugging, we can actually exploit this version history to narrow down the changes that caused the failure – be it by us or by others.\">Isolating Failure-Inducing Changes</a>\n",

    "* <a href=\"DDSetDebugger.ipynb\" title=\"Generalizing Failure Circumstances (DDSetDebugger)&#10;&#10;One central question in debugging is: Does this bug occur in other situations, too? In this chapter, we present a technique that is set to generalize the circumstances under which a failure occurs. The DDSET algorithm takes a failure-inducing input, breaks it into individual elements. For each element, it tries to find whether it can be replaced by others in the same category, and if so, it generalizes the concrete element to the very category. The result is a pattern that characterizes the failure condition: &quot;The failure occurs for all inputs of the form (&lt;expr&gt; * &lt;expr&gt;)&quot;.\">Generalizing Failure Circumstances</a>\n",
